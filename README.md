# Unity Machine Learning Agents Shoot Target
## A project made using Unity and C#

The agent is trained on a basic environment to locate a target using raycasts, and fire a projectile at it.
The agent is rewarded for successfully hitting the target, and negatively rewarded if it misses, runs into a wall or target, or the episode timer runs out.

Each agent environment is stored as an asset, and therefore is fully customizable.
